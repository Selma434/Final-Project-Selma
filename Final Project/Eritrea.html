Hadrami migrants have also settled in Eritrea in recent years. The Kunama and Nara are small ethnic minorities in the country. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The religious communities within Eritrea are unique in that they are extremely evenly split. Roughly 2% of the population claim no religion, but the remaining 98% is split down the middle: 49% Christian and 49% Muslim, although the precise numbers are somewhat debated. Although there is no one official religion and Eritrea is officially a secular state, the state recognizes the Eritrean Orthodox Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea, and Sunni Islam. Regardless of their faith, Eritreans peacefully coexist, and no religion is known for being extreme.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Eritrea was part of the ancient kingdom of Aksum. The kingdom of Axum was an ancient kingdom that existed between 100AD and 940AD, centered in the present-day Tigray Region. Aksum is believed to be the home of the Queen of Sheba and the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
