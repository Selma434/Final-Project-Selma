                    <p>Somalia is bounded by the Gulf of Aden to the north, by the Indian Ocean to the east, by Kenya and Ethiopia to the west, and by Djibouti to the northwest. Somalia’s western border was arbitrarily determined by colonial powers and divides the lands traditionally occupied by the Somali people. As a result, Somali communities are also found in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya, and the border remains a source of dispute.</p>

                    <p>Around 85% of its people are ethnic Somalis, who have inhabited the region historically.

                    <h2>A Little bit of History</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Somalia has the longest coastline in mainland Africa. The coast of the country stretches 3,025 km, the longest of all countries in mainland Africa</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Frankincense, perhaps best known as one of the gifts, alongside gold and myrrh, given to baby Jesus by the Three Wise Men in the Christian nativity story is a fragrant, ancient resin that can be found in northern Somalia. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of the most important historical figures in Somali history is Muhammad Abdallah Hassan, known popularly in English literature as the "Mad Mullah". In August 1899, with his followers, he declared a holy war against the British, Italians, and Ethiopians. He also called for Somali unity and independence. </p>

                        </div>
                    <p>In one battle, the Mullah destroyed an entire battalion of British troops, killing their captain, lieutenant colonel, and 97 soldiers. After seizing thousands of camels, horses and two cases of whisky, he mocked the British even further by sending them back their cases of whisky by a runner, stating that he had no use for them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After daring the British even further, they combined forces, drawing armies from as far as South Africa, India, and the Yao and Ashanti from Gambia. Even Ethiopia, under King Menelik, gave 5000 soldiers for the cause.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>His resistance to the British lasted until his death in November 1920.</p>
