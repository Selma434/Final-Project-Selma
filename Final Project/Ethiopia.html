                    <br>
                    <p>Ethiopia is considered to have never been colonised by some scholars, despite Italy's occupation from 1936–1941 because that did not result in a lasting colonial administration. Although in control of major towns, Italy never succeeded in conquering the entire country.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Emperor Haile Selassie I is considered the son of God among the followers of the Jamaican Rastafarianism religion. In fact, the name “Rastafari” originates from the emperor’s birthplace, Ras Tafari, which means “Prince Tafari” in Amharic. Although the Rastafari movement evolved in Jamaica, it began in Ethiopia.</p>

                    <p>Ethiopian distance runner Abebe Bikila was the first black African to win the gold medal in the Olympic Marathon in 1960, and he ran the race barefooted.
