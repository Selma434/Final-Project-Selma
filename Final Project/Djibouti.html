                    <p>Djibouti is bounded by Eritrea to the north, Ethiopia to the west and southwest, and Somalia to the south. The Gulf of Tadjoura, which opens into the Gulf of Aden supplies much of its 230 miles (370 km) of coastline.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Djibouti is a multi-ethnic country. The Afar (35%) and Somali (60%) make up the two largest ethnic groups, both of which speak Afro-Asiatic languages. The Somali people are comprised mostly of the Issas, a sub-clan of the Dir. The remaining 5% of the population is made up of Arabs, Ethiopians and Europeans, most of whom are Italian and French.</p>

                    <h2>A Little bit of History</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>It took 3 elections for Djibouti to achieve independence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In 1958, the first referendum on Djibouti’s Independence took place. Many of the Somali people of Djibouti voted for independence in the hope of a united Somalia. After the referendum, there were many complaints that votes had not been correctly counted, and that there had been vote rigging during the ballots, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.</p>
                    <br>

                    </div>
                    <p>In 1967, another referendum was held. By this point Somalia itself had gained independence (in 1960). The majority ethnic Somali residents of Djibouti voted for independence a second time. However, the vote count was in favour of staying with France. After the second referendum for Djibouti’s independence, there were allegations that vote rigging had happened again. According to official figures, although the territory was at the time inhabited by 58,240 Somali and 48,270 Afar, only 14,689 Somalis were allowed to register to vote versus 22,004 Afar. Somali representatives also claimed the French had simultaneously imported thousands of Afar nomads from neighbouring Ethiopia to further tip the odds in their favour, but the French authorities denied this.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In 1977, a third referendum took place. Finally, on the 27th June 1977, Djibouti became her own independent country.</p>
